# AppleGlot

### TLDR;

My needs at the moment were to localize some common words found across the system
(i.e Cancel, OK, Done, Next, Settings, etc.) in order to deliver them with
the Cocoa Touch Framework I was working on.

Since there is no official way to load UIKit localized strings for your personal use,
I remembered that Apple offers all the glossaries they're using via the developer portal.

AppleGlot is an extraction tool, it is able to use glossary files
from previous localizations in order to substitute the original text in the resource files
with the localized text. But this only works on 100% text matches; it will not do partial translations.

Well, this looks like a perfect fit in my case, so lets jump in and document the process for the future me.


### Localizing Strings Files Using AppleGlot


**To get your environment ready**

1. Download and Install [AppleGlot](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/appleglot_4.0/AppleGlot_4.0_v161.6.dmg)
2. Download the [Localization Glossaries](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=Glossaries) Apple is offering

Sneak peeking under the hood (`$ man appleglot`), we discover the following commands

  ```
  list        print list of components in NewBase
  getlangs    get the current base language and target language
  setlangs    set the current base language and target language
  populate    create NewLoc, using OldLoc if available
  update      update NewLoc from Glossaries
  finalize    remove temporary working files
  create      create empty environment
  ```

At a first glance, there's nothing complex about this tool, so let's dive in.


**To translate your *strings* files using AppleGlot**

1. In Terminal, create an AppleGlot environment. This is basically a glorified folder structure used by this CLI tool.

  ```sh
  $ mkdir [MyAppleGlotEnvironment]
  $ cd [MyAppleGlotEnvironment]
  $ appleglot -w create .
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  $ mkdir ToolKit_Environment
  $ cd ToolKit_Environment/
  $ appleglot -w create .
  Creating empty environment on '.'
  ```

2. Now, if we go ahead and check what actually happened on disk, we can see how an empty environment looks like.

  ```sh
  $ ls

  _ApplicationDictionaries  _OldBase			_Translations
  _LanguageGlossaries       _OldLoc			 _Translators
  _Logs				     _Projects		   _WorkGlossary
  _NewBase			      _Rules
  _NewLoc				   _Temporary
  ```

3. Set the source and target languages.

  ```sh
  $ appleglot -w setlangs [base_language_id] [target_langauge_id]
  ```

  For example, if the development language is `English` and the target is `Romanian`, pass `en` for the `base_language_id` and `ro` for `target_langauge_id`.

  ```sh
  $ appleglot -w setlangs en ro
  ```

  Now, to crosscheck the previous command we can use `getlangs` command to question the languages setup on this environment.

  ```sh
   $ appleglot getlangs
   en
   ro
  ```


4. In the Finder, paste the language resource folders into the AppleGlot environment `_NewBase` folder.
  If you use base internationalization, paste the language-specific folder, `[target_language_id].lproj`, into the `_NewBase` folder, and change the name of the folder to `[base_language_id].lproj`. For example, paste `ru.lproj` into `_NewBase`, and change the name to `en.lproj`.

  Otherwise, if you don’t use base internationalization, the `[base_language_id].lproj` folder should contain all the strings files that you want translated into the target language.

  In my case, I had to localize some strings that are used in a Cocoa Touch Framework, hence the second option suited me best.

  ```sh
  $ ls _NewLoc
  en.lproj

  $ cat _NewLoc/en.lproj/Localizable.strings
  "Cancel" = "Cancel";
  "OK" = "OK";
  "Done" = "Done";
  "Next" = "Next";
  "Settings" = "Settings";
  ```

5. Open the target language glossary `.dmg`, and copy the glossaries (files with the `.lg` extension) into the `_LanguageGlossaries` folder.
  In Terminal, populate the `_NewLoc` folder.

  ```sh
  $ appleglot -w populate
  ```
  This creates a `.ad` file in the `_ApplicationDictionaries` folder with previously translated strings and
  a `.wg` file in the `_WorkGlossary` folder that contains all the strings in your project with as much of the translations from your Language Glossaries as possible.

  Optionally, localize the remaining strings in the files with the `ad` and `wg` extensions using a third-party localization tool that supports these file formats.

  Example `en.lproj.ad`

  ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!-- Comment here. (1.0a10c2) -->
    <Proj>
    <ProjName>en.lproj</ProjName>
    </Proj>
    ```

  Example `en.lproj.wg`

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!-- Comment here. (1.0a10c2) -->
  <Proj>
  <ProjName>en.lproj</ProjName>
  <!--                                       -->
  <!--    en.lproj/../Localizable.strings    -->
  <!--                                       -->
  <File>
  <Filepath>en.lproj/Localizable.strings</Filepath>
  <TextItem>

  	<tran loc="ro" origin="LG matched text">Anulați</tran>

  </TextItem>
  <TextItem>
  <Description></Description>
  <Position>Next</Position>
  <TranslationSet>
  	<base loc="en"                         >Next</base>
  	<tran loc="ro" origin="LG matched text">Înainte</tran>
  </TranslationSet>
  </TextItem>
  <TextItem>
  <Description></Description>
  <Position>OK</Position>
  <TranslationSet>
  	<base loc="en"                         >OK</base>
  	<tran loc="ro" origin="LG matched text">OK</tran>
  </TranslationSet>
  </TextItem>
  <TextItem>
  <Description></Description>
  <Position>Settings</Position>
  <TranslationSet>
  	<base loc="en"                         >Settings</base>
  	<tran loc="ro" origin="LG matched text">Configurări</tran>
  </TranslationSet>
  </TextItem>
  </File>
  </Proj>
  ```

5. In Terminal, integrate the translations back into your strings files.

  ```
  $ appleglot -w update
  $ appleglot -w finalize
  ```

  Checking the `_NewLoc/en.lproj/Localizable.strings` we will see that the new translations have been included.
  ```sh
  "Cancel" = "Anulați";
  "OK" = "OK";
  "Done" = "OK";
  "Next" = "Înainte";
  "Settings" = "Configurări";
  ```

6. In the Finder, paste the localized resources into your Xcode project folder.
  Paste the contents of the `_NewLoc/[base_language_id].lproj` folder into your `[target_language_id].lproj` folder in the Xcode project folder. For example, paste the contents of the `_NewLoc/en.lproj` folder into the `ro.lproj` folder if the target language is Romanian.


That's all folks!
