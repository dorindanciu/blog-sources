# Setting up AnchorCMS on a DreamHost shared instance



## Requirements

1. A shared DreamHost account and fully hosted domain
2. Make sure your user has sftp rights (shell access)
3. I suggest configuring your domain to run PHP 7.2.x w/ FastCGI
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for everything to move to 7.2 (if your not there already)


## Step 1: Running PHP 7.2 in CLI (Command Line Interface)


1. Login via SSH (if you are not logged in already)
2. Navigate to ~/ (`$ cd ~/`)
3. check your php installed version
> php -v
>
>PHP 7.2.3 (cli) (built: Mar  7 2018 20:29:28) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies

4. If you are not running 7.2, create or edit the existing file (`$ vi .bash_profile`)
4. On a new line copy and paste this code
  > export PATH=/usr/local/php72/bin/:$PATH

5. Save the file and exit (`:wq`)
6. You need to logout and log back in to update the PATH variable
7. After login check again the version using `php -v`


## Step 2: Enable the Phar Extension


1. Login via Terminal or whatever flavor you like
2. Navigate to ~/ (`$ cd ~/`)
3. Create the folder ~/.php (`$ mkdir -p ~/.php/7.2`)
`Note` that you may not need to create all these folders if they are already created. In my case they where all there, from 5.6 to 7.2.
4. Create the file ~./.php/7.2/phprc (`$ vi ~/.php/7.2/phprc`)
5. Pop these jewels into the file on seperate lines
 > extension = phar.so<br />
 > suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar

6. Save the file and exit (`:wq`)


## Step 3: Installing composer locally


1. Now you can run the following command in the directory you want to use Composer in (go to the directory first then run this command)
 > curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

3. You should see some installation success messages; this is good!  
  If you see the following error:
  > \#!/usr/bin/env php  
  > Some settings on your machine make Composer unable to work properly.  
  > Make sure that you fix the issues listed below and run this script again:  
  >  
  > The phar extension is missing.  
  > Install it or recompile php without --disable-phar  

  This means you're on a DH server that has a different set of expectations for phrc. To fix it, move the `phrc` file created previously in the folder matching your PHP CLI version:

  ```
  $ cd ~/.php
  $ mkdir 5.4
  $ mv phprc 5.4/phprc
  ```

  (or, if you're using PHP 5.3, that would be `$ mkdir 5.3` and `$ mv phprc 5.3/phprc`)
4. If you don't see any errors, it should have been installed correctly, now try running it
 > php composer.phar

5. By running the command above, you should see a list of green and grey items, you've installed composer


## Step 4: Installing Anchor

1. Download the latest `tar.gz` Anchor version you can find on GitHub
2. Using FTP copy the archive to DH in your home folder
3. Uncompress it using
> tar -xvzf anchor-cms-0.12.7.tar.gz
4. Copy all the contents in the root folder, and then remove the source

 ```
mv anchor-cms-0.12.7/* ./
rm -d  anchor-cms-0.12.7
```

5. Now that we have everything cleared out, we can proceed and install the dependencies:

 ```
 curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php // in case you've missed the previously mentioned step
 php composer.phar install
 ```

6. Now you can move to the browser and complete the installation, by following the steps listed there.


 Enjoy!
